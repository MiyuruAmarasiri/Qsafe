# Qsafe Code of Conduct

Qsafe brings together cryptographers, operators, and developers to build a trustworthy quantum-safe communication stack. We commit to a community where every participant can contribute, learn, and collaborate without harassment or discrimination.

## Our Values

- **Security-first candor**: We surface risks honestly and respectfully, even when inconvenient.
- **Collaborative rigor**: We challenge ideas, not people, and assume good intent while demanding high standards.
- **Inclusive participation**: We welcome contributors regardless of background, identity, or experience level.
- **Transparency with empathy**: We share context generously and listen before responding.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and courteous when offering feedback or debating designs.
- Provide actionable, kind reviews and avoid gatekeeping behavior.
- Credit the work of others and acknowledge dependencies and inspiration.
- Follow responsible disclosure practices and protect confidential information shared under NDA or private disclosure channels.
- Seek consent before sharing recordings, screenshots, or logs that include personal information.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or hateful conduct in any form.
- Threats, stalking, doxxing, or unwelcome contact (online or offline).
- Deliberate misrepresentation of security findings or tampering with triage processes.
- Publishing others’ confidential information without permission.
- Sustained disruption of meetings, calls, or online discussions.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behavior and may take appropriate action in response to any conduct they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Maintainers will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Qsafe spaces, including GitHub repositories, discussions, issue trackers, chat rooms, community events, and private communications when acting in a project capacity or representing Qsafe.

## Reporting

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior:

- Email: `miyubhashi2002@gmail.com`
- Escalation (PGP preferred): `miyubhashi2002@gmail.com` (fingerprint `5F91 6E36 4132 F3BE 4716  C5E9 7F5D A6AD 2D62 3F4B`)

Please include relevant context (links, screenshots, timestamps) if you feel safe doing so. Reports are confidential and handled by the maintainer team. We acknowledge every report within 3 business days.

## Enforcement Process

1. **Receipt & assessment** – Maintainers review the report, gather context, and determine severity.
2. **Community impact evaluation** – We consult the guidelines below to select appropriate action.
3. **Action & communication** – We notify the affected parties of the outcome and, when possible, share lessons learned with the broader community.

### Community Impact Guidelines

| Level | Community Impact | Consequence |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **Correction** | Minor misconduct or first-time violation | Private written warning and clarification of expectations |
| **Warning** | Repeated misconduct or moderate impact | Formal warning with required behavior changes; temporary restrictions may apply |
| **Temporary Ban** | Serious violation or sustained harassment | Temporary ban from project spaces and activities |
| **Permanent Ban** | Pattern of violations, harassment, or threats to safety | Removal from community spaces and contribution privileges |

Maintainers may escalate directly to a higher level if behavior poses immediate harm.

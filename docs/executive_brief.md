# Executive Brief

## Strategic Objective
Deliver a quantum-resistant, policy-enforceable communication layer that preserves confidentiality, integrity, and availability in adversarial environments while maintaining regulatory compliance and observability parity with classical stacks.

## MVP Value Proposition
- **Future-proof key exchange**: ML-KEM (Kyber) encapsulation guarantees resilience against cryptanalytic advances while maintaining performant handshakes.
- **Verifiable identities**: TPM/HSM-backed attestations create non-repudiable device provenance and mitigate credential theft or device cloning.
- **Transport flexibility**: A single cryptographic core supports gRPC, WebSockets, and emerging protocols to minimize re-integration costs.
- **Operational trust**: Built-in telemetry, threat models, and red-teaming harnesses ensure continuous monitoring of downgrade, timing, and side-channel risks.
- **Compliance readiness**: Documentation aligns with NIST PQC, FIPS, and evolving regulatory expectations around crypto agility and key management.

## Release Targets
1. Stand up hybrid PQ handshake between reference gateway and agent.
2. Ship automated compliance and threat-model documentation.
3. Integrate CI/CD artifacts attesting to binary provenance and dependency health.

## Success Metrics
- Handshake latency increase < 20% relative to classical TLS 1.3 baseline under target load.
- 100% coverage of negotiated sessions emitting telemetry to central collector within 3 seconds.
- Zero critical downgrade paths in red-team harness before production trials.
